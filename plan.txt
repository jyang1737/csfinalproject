Things To Do (Necessary):
	1. Implement choosers into Attack
	2. Fix bug detected in move
	3. Finish coding Attack
	4. Update code to include limits on what turtle moves based on who is doing the actions (player 1 or 2?)

Things To Do (not immediately necessary)
	1. Create more turtles of different shapes
	2. Talk about which spells to use
	3. 

Things To Consider
	1. Creating different skillsets (different characters with different spells -- that will put the focus on spells instead though)
	2. Creating barriers and obstacles
	3. Combo-abilities? (e.g. two-turn aoe spell + teleport to middle of the spell (on 2nd turn) = aoe dmg on pre-teleport location instead (also focuses on spells instead).
	4. Distinguishing between the two players by color

Code:
	1. Setup
	2. Go
	   a. move: operated by mouse (coded). Need to decide how to implement moveyet? to stop from spam-clicking, but also give the option of not-moving
	   b. attack: Either operated by mouse or by button (both with choosers). Ifelse statements let code know which chooser is used. Same problem as move
	   c. spells: operated by mouse. 
	   d. EndDecisions: (Coded)
	   e. View: will reveal all hidden turtles and show what happened.
